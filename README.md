# Graphics
Visial depictions of things, picture, diagram, drawing, art, 2d 3d 4d . Rendering off line & real time.

Exploring relation, if there is any to be found with current tech, between graphics and artificial visual cortex.

Exploding relation, caveats, with global warming and climate change modeling. 

An excuse, suggested by a good man, to start a Cpp project.
